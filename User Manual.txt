User Manual

Players have the option to play in single or multiplayer modes.

***Single Player Mode***

The objective of the game is to hit the ball into the score zone, which is
denoted by a dark green box on a red wall. Each score is worth 1 point, and the goal is to score as many points as possible. The score zone will change to a random position on the red wall every time it is hit and the ball will get a velocity boost. If the player misses the ball and it goes past the paddle or the ball is allowed to come to a slow creep, they lose and must restart the game. To control the paddle use the following controls:

Move the mouse ->   Move the paddle around
Up Arrow 	   ->  	pitch paddle to face upwards    -> Alternative Key: J
Down Arrow 	   ->   pitch paddle to face downwards  -> Alternative Key: H 
Right Arrow    ->  	roll paddle to the Right        -> Alternative Key: K 
Left Arrow     ->  	roll maddle to the Left         -> Alternative Key: L

Use the SPACE bar to start the game and to hit the ball with the paddle.
Important note: You must hit the ball with the paddle or the ball will
eventually stop moving.

Use the R key to pause and restart the game.

There is also a menu the player can click on with the mouse to pause the game, turn on/off sounds, and quit the game.


***Mutiplayer Mode***

Once multiplayer is chosen, a player can choose to be a host or search for another host. Once a connection is made, the game begins. The controls are the same, but the scoring system is different. The goal is now to get the ball past the opponent's paddle. Hit the ball into the opposing player's wall to score a point. The first player to score three points wins the game.
